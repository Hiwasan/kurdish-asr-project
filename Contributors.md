## Collaboration Model

This project operates on a **complementary expertise partnership** model, where each contributor leads in their domain of specialization while collaborating closely on shared objectives:

- **Domain-specific ownership**: Each contributor has primary responsibility for their expertise area
- **Joint decision making**: Technical and linguistic decisions made collaboratively  
- **Shared attribution**: All outputs acknowledge both technical and linguistic contributions
- **Equal partnership**: Both contributors are co-investigators on publications and grants

## Contribution Areas

## Recognition and Attribution

All project outputs including publications, presentations, and grant applications will:

- **Co-acknowledge both contributors** as equal partners in appropriate contexts
- **Specify expertise contributions** clearly in technical documentation
- **Maintain clear attribution** for domain-specific innovations and contributions

## External Collaborations

Future contributors and collaborators will be welcomed based on:
- **Complementary expertise** that enhances project capabilities
- **Alignment with project goals** and collaborative research values  
- **Professional standards** for academic and technical collaboration
- **Mutual benefit** for all project participants

## Communication and Coordination

### Regular Coordination
- **Weekly technical sync meetings** during active development phases
- **Monthly strategic planning** for longer-term objectives and milestones
- **Quarterly progress reviews** and goal adjustment sessions

### Decision Making
- **Technical decisions**: Led by technical expert with linguistic domain input
- **Linguistic decisions**: Led by domain expert with technical feasibility input
- **Strategic decisions**: Joint discussion and consensus-based approach
- **Publication decisions**: Shared planning and co-authorship agreements

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the broader Kurdish linguistic community whose language and cultural heritage make this research possible and meaningful. This project is conducted with deep respect for Kurdish linguistic diversity and cultural significance.

We also recognize the broader research communities in computational linguistics and speech processing whose foundational work enables our technical approach.

## Linked Project: CLaST Initiative

This ASR work is part of a larger cross-border research initiative led by Dr. Hiwa Asadpour as Principal Investigator:

Collaborative Language preservation and Speech Technology (CLaST): a cross-border initiative for European and Western Asia minority language

A German-French collaboration focused on minority language technology and documentation across Europe and Western Asia.

    Lead Institutions:

        Goethe University Frankfurt (Germany)

        Centre National de Recherche Scientifique – CNRS (France)

    Partner Institutions:

        Germany: Saarland University, University of Bochum, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)

        France: Université Paris-Nanterre, Université Paris VIII, Université de Tours, Laboratoire des sciences et techniques de l’information, de la communication et de la connaissance

    Guest Institutions: University of Vienna (Austria), Technical University of Liberec (Czech Republic)

The Kurdish ASR project is developed privately by Dr. Hiwa Asadpour and Dr. Mohammad Mohammadamini under this umbrella, and serves as a key contribution to the CLaST research themes. Results will be shared with the broader network team and integrated into the larger collaboration roadmap.

*This collaboration represents a model for effective academic-industry partnership in under-resourced language technology development, combining deep domain expertise with cutting-edge technical innovation.*
