# Kurdish Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System

A research project developing ASR technology for Kurdish language dialects, building on 23 years of specialized linguistic fieldwork and computational linguistics expertise.

## Project Vision

This project addresses the critical gap in speech recognition technology for Kurdish languages by creating a robust ASR system that captures the rich dialectal variations and linguistic complexity of Kurdish speech.

## Dataset Overview

Our Kurdish linguistic corpus represents one of the most comprehensive collections of Kurdish dialectal speech data:

- **Coverage**: Multiple Kurdish dialects and regional variations
- **Duration**: Substantial audio content with high-quality transcriptions
- **Annotations**: Detailed linguistic annotations and translations
- **Quality**: Professional linguistic fieldwork standards maintained over 23 years
- **Uniqueness**: Captures dialectal variations rarely documented in existing datasets

*Note: Due to the sensitive and proprietary nature of the linguistic data, the actual corpus is stored in secure, access-controlled environments.*

## Technical Approach

**ASR Pipeline Architecture**

- Input Processing: Multi-format audio normalization and feature extraction
- Model Architecture: State-of-the-art transformer-based ASR models adapted for Kurdish
- Training Strategy: Transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques
- Evaluation Framework: Comprehensive metrics including dialectal performance analysis

## Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Current)
- Project structure and development framework
- Sample data preparation and access protocols
- Baseline ASR pipeline development
- Initial performance benchmarking

**Phase 2: Core Development**
- Advanced model architecture implementation
- Dialectal adaptation strategies
- Performance optimization and tuning
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

**Phase 3: Scaling & Validation**
- Extended dataset integration
- Community validation and feedback
- Performance analysis across dialect groups
- Technical documentation and reproducibility

## Expected Outcomes

**Technical Contributions**
- Novel ASR Architecture: Specialized for Kurdish phonological characteristics
- Dialectal Adaptation Methods: Techniques for handling multiple Kurdish dialects
- Performance Benchmarks: Establishing evaluation standards for Kurdish ASR
- Open Source Tools: Reusable components for low-resourced language ASR
