# CHANGELOG

## [2024-11-06] - Project Ownership and Attribution Update

### Changed
* Removed all references to former collaborator Dr. Mohammad Mohammadamini from project documentation
* Updated project leadership section to reflect current sole development and ownership by Dr. Hiwa Asadpour
* Removed technical leadership attributions previously listed for former collaborator
* Updated all contact information to reflect current project lead only
* Revised contributor acknowledgments to reflect accurate participation
* Updated license and copyright information to current owner

### Background and Reason for Changes
This update was made necessary due to material breach of collaboration terms by the former collaborator, specifically:

1. **Confidentiality Breach**: Unauthorized use of proprietary project data, algorithms, and materials on third-party servers without permission or notification
2. **Data Usage Violations**: Processing and storage of project data in violation of agreed-upon data handling protocols and security requirements
3. **Breach of Trust**: Actions taken without consultation or consent that compromised project integrity and data security

As a result, the informal collaboration arrangement was terminated effective [insert date], and all future development proceeds under sole direction of Dr. Hiwa Asadpour.

### Clarification of Contributions
For transparency and accuracy:

* **Primary Development**: All core architecture, primary algorithms, implementation, and majority of research work completed by Dr. Hiwa Asadpour
* **Former Collaborator Role**: Limited advisory input and consultation on specific technical aspects during collaboration period [start date] - [end date]
* **IP Ownership**: All intellectual property, code, data, and project materials remain the exclusive property of Dr. Hiwa Asadpour, as original creator and primary developer
* **No Joint Ownership**: No formal collaboration agreement, partnership, or joint ownership was ever established
